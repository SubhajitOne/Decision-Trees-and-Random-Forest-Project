# Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forest-Project
The dataset is from LendingClub.com, here there are investors who invest in lending money to borrowers who need money.
Hopefully, as an investor one would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying back.
We will try to create a model that will help predict this.
Here the 'not.fully.paid' is the labeled column.
Explpratory Data Analysis was done to see how features are related to 'not.fully.paid' column.
Changing Categorical variables to Dummy variables.
Creating Decision Tree Model and Random Forest Model and evaluating each with the help of confusion matrix and classification report.
